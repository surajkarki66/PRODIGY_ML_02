# PRODIGY_ML_02
## Overview
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. All the steps that are required for the experiment such as data preparation, model building, training, evaluation and saving are provided in the IPython notebook: `PRODIGY_ML_02.ipynb`. The model inference was done on `app.py`

## How to do inference?
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajkarki66/PRODIGY_ML_02
   ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate the environment based on your machine(Linux, MacOS, and Windows)
3. Install the requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the following command
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
